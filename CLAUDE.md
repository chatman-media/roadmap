# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a roadmap planning repository for Chatman Media's 2025+ initiatives. The repository is currently in its initial state and appears to be intended for documentation and planning purposes rather than code development.

## Repository Structure

The repository has a minimal structure:
- `README.md` - Main roadmap documentation (currently just contains title)
- `.claude/` - Claude AI configuration directory

## Development Commands

As this is a documentation repository, there are no build, test, or development commands configured. If code is added in the future, this section should be updated with relevant commands.

## Working with this Repository

Since this appears to be a planning/documentation repository:
1. Focus on helping with markdown documentation and roadmap structuring
2. When creating new documentation, maintain clear organization with appropriate markdown headers
3. If the repository evolves to include code, update this file with relevant development instructions
